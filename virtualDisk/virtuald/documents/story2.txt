Molly MacDonald looked at the warped gun in her hands and felt relaxed.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her beautiful surroundings. She had always loved cosy Athens with its muddy, magnificent mountains. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel relaxed.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Polly Blackman. Polly was a malicious angel with sticky arms and fluffy arms.

Molly gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was an intelligent, violent, brandy drinker with pointy arms and charming arms. Her friends saw her as a dirty, doubtful do gooder. Once, she had even brought a cruel kitten back from the brink of death.

But not even an intelligent person who had once brought a cruel kitten back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Polly had in store today.

The drizzle rained like thinking puppies, making Molly delighted.

As Molly stepped outside and Polly came closer, she could see the wooden smile on her face.

"Look Molly," growled Polly, with an energetic glare that reminded Molly of malicious snakes. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want revenge. You owe me 80 pounds."

Molly looked back, even more delighted and still fingering the warped gun. "Polly, I shrunk the kids," she replied.

They looked at each other with barmy feelings, like two angry, ashamed aardvarks bopping at a very energetic birthday party, which had piano music playing in the background and two intuitive uncles singing to the beat.

Molly regarded Polly's sticky arms and fluffy arms. "I don't have the funds ..." she lied.

Polly glared. "Do you want me to shove that warped gun where the sun don't shine?"

Molly promptly remembered her intelligent and violent values. "Actually, I do have the funds," she admitted. She reached into her pockets. "Here's what I owe you."

Polly looked concerned, her wallet blushing like a gleaming, good guillotine.

Then Polly came inside for a nice glass of brandy.
THE END
